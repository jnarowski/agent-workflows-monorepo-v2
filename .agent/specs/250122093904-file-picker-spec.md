# Feature: File Picker for Chat Prompt

## What We're Building

A file reference system that allows users to type `@` in the chat prompt to search and insert file paths from the current project. Uses fuzzy search (Fuse.js) for quick file discovery and displays files with a clean UI showing filename and directory path. Automatically tracks which files are referenced in the prompt.

## User Story

As a chat user
I want to quickly reference project files by typing `@` and searching
So that I can easily add file context to my prompts without manually typing full paths

## Technical Approach

Extract project ID from URL params, fetch file tree via existing API (`/api/projects/:id/files`), flatten the tree structure, and implement fuzzy search using Fuse.js. Use a controlled Popover component that opens on `@` trigger or button click. Parse textarea content to track added files, insert paths at cursor position, and support removal of all file occurrences. Component structure separates concerns: ChatPromptInput manages state/logic, ChatPromptInputFiles handles UI/search.

## Files to Touch

### Existing Files

- `apps/web/src/client/components/chat/ChatPromptInput.tsx` - Add project ID extraction, cursor tracking, file insertion/removal logic
- `apps/web/src/client/components/chat/ChatPromptInputFiles.tsx` - Major refactor to add file fetching, fuzzy search, and two-section UI
- `apps/web/package.json` - Add fuse.js dependency

### New Files

- `apps/web/src/client/lib/fileUtils.ts` - Utility functions for file operations (flatten tree, parse references, cursor insertion)
- `apps/web/src/client/lib/fileUtils.test.ts` - Unit tests for file utilities
- `apps/web/src/client/components/ui/file-badge.tsx` - File type badge component with color mapping
- `apps/web/src/client/components/ui/file-badge.test.tsx` - Unit tests for file badge
- `apps/web/src/client/components/chat/ChatPromptInput.test.tsx` - Integration tests for prompt input
- `apps/web/src/client/components/chat/ChatPromptInputFiles.test.tsx` - Integration tests for file picker

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

Create utility functions and types for file operations. Set up file tree flattening, path parsing, cursor position manipulation, and file type detection. Install Fuse.js dependency. Create comprehensive unit tests to ensure all utilities work correctly before integration.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

Build the file badge component for visual file type indicators. Update ChatPromptInput to track cursor position and manage file insertion/removal. Refactor ChatPromptInputFiles to fetch files from API, implement Fuse.js search, and build the two-section UI (Added Files + Search Results) matching the design specification.

### Phase 3: Integration

Connect all pieces together, ensure proper data flow from parent to child components, handle edge cases (empty projects, API errors, special characters), add keyboard navigation, and validate the complete user flow from typing `@` to inserting file paths.

## Step by Step Tasks

**IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom**

#### Completion Notes

## Acceptance Criteria

**Must Work:**

- [ ] Unchecking a file removes all its occurrences from prompt
- [ ] File badges show correct colors for different file types
- [ ] File paths are relative to project root
- [ ] Cursor position is maintained after insertion
- [ ] Menu search input auto-focuses when opened

**Should Not:**

- [ ] Break existing chat functionality
- [ ] Cause performance issues with large file trees (>1000 files)
- [ ] Insert @ symbol with file path
- [ ] Show duplicate files in search results
- [ ] Keep menu open after file selection
- [ ] Remove partial matches when unchecking files
- [ ] Crash on empty project or API errors

## Validation

Execute these commands to verify the feature works correctly:

**Automated Verification:**

```bash
# Build verification
cd apps/web && pnpm build
# Expected: Clean build with no errors

# Type checking
cd apps/web && pnpm check-types
# Expected: No TypeScript errors

# Linting
cd apps/web && pnpm lint
# Expected: No linting errors

# Unit tests
cd apps/web && pnpm test fileUtils.test.ts
# Expected: All utility tests pass (flattenFileTree, extractFileReferences, insertAtCursor, removeAllOccurrences, getFileTypeInfo)

cd apps/web && pnpm test file-badge.test.tsx
# Expected: All badge component tests pass

# Integration tests
cd apps/web && pnpm test ChatPromptInput.test.tsx
# Expected: All input integration tests pass (@ trigger, insertion, removal, cursor tracking)

cd apps/web && pnpm test ChatPromptInputFiles.test.tsx
# Expected: All file picker integration tests pass (loading, search, selection)

# Full test suite
cd apps/web && pnpm test
# Expected: All tests pass, coverage >80% for new code
```

**Manual Verification:**

1. Start application: `cd apps/web && pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/projects/{project-id}/chat`
3. Type `@` in the chat prompt input
4. Verify: Menu opens with file list and focused search input
5. Type fuzzy search query (e.g., "pmpin")
6. Verify: Results filter to matching files (e.g., "ChatPromptInput.tsx")
7. Click a file from search results
8. Verify: File path inserted at cursor, @ removed, menu closes
9. Type multiple file paths manually in prompt
10. Open @ menu again
11. Verify: "Added Files" section shows all referenced files
12. Click checkmark to remove a file
13. Verify: All occurrences removed from prompt text
14. Test cursor insertion at different positions (start, middle, end)
15. Check console: No errors or warnings

**Feature-Specific Checks:**

- Test with empty project (no files): Should show "No files found" message
- Test with API error: Should display error state gracefully
- Test file with spaces: "my file.tsx" should work correctly
- Test very long path: Should truncate with ellipsis in UI
- Test rapid @ triggering: Menu should open/close smoothly
- Test fuzzy search edge cases: Single letter, symbols, numbers
- Test file badges: TS (blue), JS (yellow), JSON (gray), MD (green), other (light gray)
- Test "Added Files" parsing performance: Should parse in <100ms even with long prompt text
- Verify Fuse.js search performance: Should return results in <50ms

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed in order
- [ ] Unit tests passing (fileUtils, file-badge)
- [ ] Integration tests passing (ChatPromptInput, ChatPromptInputFiles)
- [ ] Type checks pass with no errors
- [ ] Lint checks pass with no warnings
- [ ] Manual testing confirms all acceptance criteria
- [ ] No console errors during usage
- [ ] Code follows existing component patterns
- [ ] Fuzzy search works as expected (Fuse.js configured correctly)
- [ ] File badges render with correct colors
- [ ] "Added Files" section parses and displays correctly
- [ ] File insertion/removal works at all cursor positions
- [ ] Edge cases handled (empty project, API errors, special characters)
- [ ] Performance verified with large file trees

## Notes

- Uses existing `/api/projects/:id/files` API endpoint (already implemented)
- Reuses `useProjectFiles` hook from FileTree feature
- File tree structure is already typed in `@/shared/types/file.types.ts`
- Fuse.js configuration (threshold 0.4, weighted keys) balances fuzzy matching with accuracy
- Simple regex pattern for file path extraction is intentionally permissive
- Performance optimization: Only parse textarea for added files when menu opens
- Future consideration: Add keyboard shortcuts for file insertion (e.g., Ctrl+K)
- Future consideration: Show file preview on hover
- Future consideration: Group files by directory in search results
- Future consideration: Support glob patterns in search (e.g., "*.tsx")
