# Feature: Unified Diff Viewer Component

## What We're Building

A single, unified `DiffViewer` component that consolidates `RawGitDiffViewer` and `SideBySideDiffViewer` using Shiki's built-in diff language support. This will add syntax highlighting to AI edit tool diffs (currently missing) and provide consistent diff visualization across git operations and AI code edits.

## User Story

As a developer using the agent workflow platform
I want to see consistently formatted and syntax-highlighted diffs across all features
So that I can easily understand code changes whether they come from git operations or AI edits

## Technical Approach

Create a unified `DiffViewer` component that:
1. Accepts both pre-formatted git diff strings AND old/new string pairs
2. Uses the `diff` library's `createPatch()` to convert old/new strings into unified diff format
3. Renders all diffs using Shiki's built-in `diff` language for consistent syntax highlighting
4. Maintains existing features: theme switching, optional headers, line numbers
5. Replaces both `RawGitDiffViewer` (git operations) and `SideBySideDiffViewer` (AI edits)

## Files to Touch

### Existing Files

- `apps/web/src/client/pages/projects/git/components/ChangesView.tsx` - Update to use new DiffViewer
- `apps/web/src/client/pages/projects/git/components/CommitDiffView.tsx` - Update to use new DiffViewer
- `apps/web/src/client/pages/projects/git/components/FileChangeItem.tsx` - Update to use new DiffViewer
- `apps/web/src/client/pages/projects/sessions/components/session/claude/tools/EditToolRenderer.tsx` - Update to use new DiffViewer
- `apps/web/src/client/pages/projects/sessions/components/session/claude/blocks/EditToolBlock.tsx` - Update to use new DiffViewer and remove diffLines import
- `apps/web/package.json` - Remove unused dependencies

### New Files

- `apps/web/src/client/components/DiffViewer.tsx` - New unified diff viewer component

### Files to Delete

- `apps/web/src/client/pages/projects/git/components/RawGitDiffViewer.tsx` - Replaced by DiffViewer
- `apps/web/src/client/pages/projects/sessions/components/SideBySideDiffViewer.tsx` - Replaced by DiffViewer

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

Create the new `DiffViewer` component with dual input support (diff string or old/new strings). Implement unified diff generation using the `diff` library's `createPatch()` function. Set up Shiki integration with the `diff` language and theme awareness.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

Migrate all git-related components (`ChangesView`, `CommitDiffView`, `FileChangeItem`) to use the new `DiffViewer`. Then migrate AI tool components (`EditToolRenderer`, `EditToolBlock`) to use the new component with old/new string inputs.

### Phase 3: Integration

Remove old components and clean up dependencies. Verify all diff displays work correctly across git and AI features. Test theme switching and edge cases.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Must Work:**

- [ ] Git diffs display correctly with syntax highlighting in Changes view
- [ ] Git commit history diffs display correctly with metadata
- [ ] AI Edit tool diffs display with syntax highlighting (NEW - currently missing)
- [ ] Theme switching works (light/dark mode) for all diff displays
- [ ] Optional headers work (git metadata can be shown/hidden)
- [ ] Line numbers can be enabled when needed
- [ ] Empty diffs and edge cases are handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance is comparable to or better than existing components

**Should Not:**

- [ ] Break any existing git functionality
- [ ] Break any existing AI tool functionality
- [ ] Introduce console errors or warnings
- [ ] Cause visual regressions in diff display
- [ ] Impact page load performance negatively

## Validation

Execute these commands to verify the feature works correctly:

**Automated Verification:**

```bash
# Build verification
cd apps/web && pnpm build
# Expected: Build completes successfully with no errors

# Type checking
cd apps/web && pnpm check-types
# Expected: No type errors

# Linting
cd apps/web && pnpm lint
# Expected: No lint errors

# Start dev server
cd apps/web && pnpm dev
# Expected: Server starts without errors
```

**Manual Verification:**

1. Start application: `cd apps/web && pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to: Projects → Select a project → Source Control tab
3. Verify: Git diffs display with syntax highlighting
4. Navigate to: Projects → Select a project → History tab
5. Verify: Commit diffs display with syntax highlighting and metadata
6. Navigate to: Projects → Select a project → Session tab
7. Make an edit using the AI agent that uses the Edit tool
8. Verify: Edit tool diffs now show syntax highlighting (major improvement!)
9. Toggle theme: Switch between light and dark mode
10. Verify: All diffs adapt to theme correctly
11. Check console: No errors or warnings

**Feature-Specific Checks:**

- Test with different file types (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, etc.)
- Test with large diffs (>100 lines)
- Test with empty diffs
- Test git diffs with and without headers
- Test old/new string conversion produces valid unified diff format
- Verify Edit tool diffs look professional and readable (like git diffs)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] DiffViewer component created and working
- [ ] All 5 components migrated to use DiffViewer
- [ ] Old components deleted
- [ ] Unused dependencies removed
- [ ] Tests passing (if any exist)
- [ ] Lint and Type Checks pass
- [ ] Manual testing confirms working across all use cases
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns in SyntaxHighlighter.tsx
- [ ] AI Edit tool diffs now have syntax highlighting

## Notes

**Key Benefits:**
- AI edit diffs gain syntax highlighting for the first time
- Consistent UX across all diff displays
- Single component to maintain
- Reduced dependencies (remove 2 unused packages)
- Better code readability

**Implementation Dependencies:**
- Requires `diff` library (already installed) for `createPatch()` function
- Uses existing Shiki integration and SyntaxHighlighter component
- No new external dependencies needed

**Future Considerations:**
- Could add side-by-side view option in future if needed
- Could add inline diff markers for more granular highlighting
- Could add diff stats (additions/deletions count) to component
