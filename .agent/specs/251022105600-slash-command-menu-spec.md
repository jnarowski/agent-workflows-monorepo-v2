# Feature: Slash Command Menu

## What We're Building

A "/" trigger menu for slash commands, similar to the existing "@" file picker. The menu displays both default Claude Code built-in commands (23 total) and project-specific custom commands loaded from `.claude/commands/**/*.md` with full namespace support using colon-separated paths (e.g., `/e2e:chat`, `/backend:api:users`). Users can search, select, and insert commands at the beginning of the textarea with argument hints displayed inline.

## User Story

As a chat user
I want to quickly insert slash commands by typing "/" and searching
So that I can efficiently use both built-in Claude Code commands and project-specific custom commands without memorizing command names

## Technical Approach

Following the file-picker pattern: Create a new API endpoint to recursively scan `.claude/commands/**/*.md` from the currently selected project's root path, parse YAML frontmatter using gray-matter to extract descriptions and argument hints, construct namespaced command names from folder structure (folder/subfolder/file.md â†’ /folder:subfolder:file), and merge with hardcoded default commands. Use same Popover + Command UI pattern as file picker with Fuse.js fuzzy search. ChatPromptInput detects "/" trigger using useParams to get projectId, manages separate state for slash menu alongside existing @ menu, and inserts selected command at position 0 while moving existing text after it.

## Files to Touch

### Existing Files

- `apps/web/src/client/components/chat/ChatPromptInput.tsx` - Add "/" trigger detection, slash menu state management, extract projectId via useParams
- `apps/web/src/server/index.ts` - Register new slash-commands routes
- `apps/web/package.json` - Add gray-matter dependency for frontmatter parsing

### New Files

- `apps/web/src/shared/types/slash-command.types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for SlashCommand
- `apps/web/src/server/services/slash-command.service.ts` - Recursive scanning, namespace construction, frontmatter parsing
- `apps/web/src/server/routes/slash-commands.ts` - API route handler for GET /api/projects/:id/slash-commands
- `apps/web/src/server/schemas/slash-command.schema.ts` - Zod validation schemas
- `apps/web/src/client/lib/slashCommandUtils.ts` - Default command list (23 built-in commands), utility functions
- `apps/web/src/client/lib/slashCommandUtils.test.ts` - Unit tests for utilities
- `apps/web/src/client/hooks/useSlashCommands.ts` - React Query hook to fetch commands
- `apps/web/src/client/components/chat/ChatPromptInputSlashCommands.tsx` - Slash command menu Popover UI

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

Install gray-matter dependency. Create shared TypeScript types for SlashCommand interface. Build server-side service to recursively scan project's `.claude/commands/**/*.md` directory, parse frontmatter, construct namespaced command names from folder paths using colon separators. Create list of 23 default Claude Code built-in commands. Write comprehensive unit tests for namespace construction logic.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

Create API endpoint GET /api/projects/:id/slash-commands that loads project from database, scans commands directory, returns merged default + custom commands. Build React Query hook to fetch commands. Create ChatPromptInputSlashCommands component with Popover, search input, and command list using Fuse.js for fuzzy filtering. Display commands in two sections (Built-in vs Project) with argument hints.

### Phase 3: Integration

Update ChatPromptInput to use useParams for projectId extraction, add isSlashMenuOpen state, detect "/" trigger in handleTextChange. Implement command insertion logic (position 0, move existing text after). Test dual menu behavior (@ for files, / for commands). Manual testing with nested folder structures and namespaced commands.

8. Navigate to a project with `.claude/commands/` directory
9. Verify: "Project Commands" section appears
10. Verify: Custom commands load with correct names
11. Create test file: `.claude/commands/test/nested/example.md` with frontmatter

14. Verify: Command inserted at position 0 with trailing space
15. Type "some text" in textarea, then type "/" and select command
16. Verify: Command inserted first, "some text" moved after
17. Verify: Menu closes after selection
18. Type "@" and verify file picker still works
19. Check console: No errors or warnings

**Feature-Specific Checks:**

- Test with project that has no `.claude/commands/` directory: Should show only 23 built-in commands, no errors

## Notes

- Uses existing `/api/projects/:id/files` pattern for consistency
- Reuses Fuse.js from file picker feature (already installed)
- gray-matter is industry standard for frontmatter parsing (3M+ downloads/week)
- Default command list should be updated periodically as Claude Code evolves
- Future consideration: Add keyboard shortcuts for command insertion (e.g., Ctrl+/)
- Future consideration: Show recently used commands at top
- Future consideration: Support MCP commands (dynamically loaded from /mcp__*)
- Future consideration: Allow editing custom commands from UI
- Namespace format matches Claude Code's official pattern: /plugin:command
- Security: File reading is scoped to project.path, same as existing file service
- Performance: Recursive scanning cached by React Query (5min default)
