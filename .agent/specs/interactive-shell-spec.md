# Feature: Interactive Shell

## What We're Building

A full-featured interactive terminal shell integrated into the apps/web application that allows users to execute commands in the context of their project directory. The shell uses xterm.js for the frontend terminal emulator, node-pty for real pseudo-terminal on the backend, and WebSocket for real-time communication. Sessions persist across route navigation using React Context.

## User Story

As a developer using the agent workflows platform
I want to interact with my projects through an integrated terminal shell
So that I can run commands, execute scripts, and interact with my codebase without leaving the application

## Technical Approach

**Backend**: Use Fastify WebSocket with node-pty to spawn real PTY processes (bash on Unix, PowerShell on Windows) in the project root directory. Authenticate connections using existing JWT tokens. Manage session lifecycle and cleanup.

**Frontend**: Use modern @xterm/xterm scoped packages with addons (fit, webgl, clipboard) for the terminal UI. Store terminal sessions in React Context to persist across route changes. Use custom hook for WebSocket management.

**State Management**: React Context pattern (matching existing AuthContext) to manage terminal sessions, WebSocket connections, and connection states across the application.

## Files to Touch

### Existing Files

- `apps/web/package.json` - Add node-pty and xterm dependencies
- `apps/web/src/server/index.ts` - Register shell WebSocket route
- `apps/web/src/client/App.tsx` - Add ShellProvider and shell route

### New Files

- `apps/web/src/server/services/shell.service.ts` - PTY session management service
- `apps/web/src/server/schemas/shell.schema.ts` - Zod validation schemas for WebSocket messages
- `apps/web/src/server/routes/shell.ts` - WebSocket handler for shell connections
- `apps/web/src/client/contexts/ShellContext.tsx` - React Context for terminal session state
- `apps/web/src/client/hooks/useShellWebSocket.ts` - WebSocket connection hook
- `apps/web/src/client/hooks/useTerminalSession.ts` - Session accessor hook
- `apps/web/src/client/components/terminal/Terminal.tsx` - Main xterm.js terminal component
- `apps/web/src/client/components/terminal/ShellControls.tsx` - Connect/disconnect UI controls
- `apps/web/src/client/components/terminal/terminal.css` - Terminal styling
- `apps/web/src/client/pages/Shell.tsx` - Shell page with project selector

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

Install dependencies, create validation schemas, set up React Context for state management, and establish base service structure. This provides the foundation for both backend PTY management and frontend terminal rendering.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

Implement PTY service with platform detection, WebSocket route handler with JWT authentication, terminal component with xterm.js addons, and WebSocket hook for connection management. This is the core functionality.

### Phase 3: Integration

Create shell page UI with project selector, integrate routing, add styling, perform comprehensive testing (unit, integration, manual), and document the feature.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Must Work:**

- [ ] User can select a project and connect to a shell in that project's directory
- [ ] Terminal displays command output in real-time
- [ ] User can type commands and see them executed
- [ ] Copy/paste works with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+C when text selected, Cmd/Ctrl+V)
- [ ] Terminal auto-resizes when window size changes
- [ ] Terminal dimensions sync to backend PTY
- [ ] User can disconnect and reconnect to shell
- [ ] Terminal sessions persist when navigating to other routes and back
- [ ] Multiple terminal sessions can run simultaneously for different projects
- [ ] Process exit codes are displayed when commands complete

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] Build passes with no errors
- [ ] Type checking passes with no errors
- [ ] Lint passes with no warnings
- [ ] Manual testing confirms all acceptance criteria met
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in browser
- [ ] No errors in backend logs during normal operation
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns (Fastify routes, React hooks, Context usage)
- [ ] Terminal sessions properly cleaned up on disconnect
- [ ] WebSocket connections properly authenticated
- [ ] Works on both macOS (bash) and Windows (PowerShell) if tested
- [ ] Documentation added (if needed for complex setup)

## Notes

**Security Considerations:**
- WebSocket connections MUST be authenticated with JWT tokens
- Consider limiting shell access to user's own projects only
- PTY processes should run with appropriate user permissions
- Consider adding session timeout to prevent zombie processes
- Validate project paths to prevent directory traversal attacks

**Future Enhancements:**
- Command history stored in localStorage
- Split terminal view (multiple terminals in same page)
- Terminal tabs per project
- Font size controls
- Color scheme picker
- Shell preference selector (bash/zsh/fish)
- Download session logs as text file
- Integration with @repo/agent-cli-sdk for enhanced Claude/Codex features

**Performance Considerations:**
- WebGL rendering provides GPU acceleration (graceful fallback to canvas)
- Session persistence reduces overhead of creating new terminals
- Limit maximum number of concurrent sessions per user (recommend: 5)
- Consider session timeout for inactive shells (recommend: 1 hour)

**Cleanup:**
- Terminal instances must be disposed on unmount/session removal
- WebSocket connections must be closed properly
- PTY processes must be killed on disconnect
- Context cleanup on user logout or app unmount
