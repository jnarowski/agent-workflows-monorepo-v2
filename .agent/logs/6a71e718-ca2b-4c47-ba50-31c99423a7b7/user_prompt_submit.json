I can continue conversations where they left off later on. I can see a list of all of my conversations in the sidebar and click through them\n\nscope:\\\n- I can create a new blank chat for a project\n- I can send a question and configuration to the claude code cli (using agent-cli-sdk)\\\\\n- I can switch between chat sessions and add additional followup questions\\\n- I can see  my token usage for each session as it grows\n- I can see the response from claude via websockets\\\n- set session id when the chat starts. \\\n- use this session id to resume the chat with { sessionId: xxxx, resume: yyyy }\\\n- can set permission mode for claude \\\n- I can upload images to send to claude\\\n- I can see a list of all of my conversations in the sidebar and navigate between sessions\\\n- When I click a session from the sidebar, it should update the URL and take me to that session\n\\\nreview:\\\n- read the entire project - @apps/claudecodeui to see how they do it\\\n- read the entire project @packages/agent-cli-sdk/ to see interface and options\\\n\\\nthings to consider:\\\n- what do we need to store in the database VS what is already stored in .claude/projects (for historical reference)\\\n\\\nWhat questions do you have for me?\\\nWhat needs further scoping or clarification?"
