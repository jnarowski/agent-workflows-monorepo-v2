Custom commands can be:\n- Project-specific\n- Personal commands\n\nThe documentation distinguishes slash commands from Skills, noting different use cases for each approach.\n\n## On-Demand Loading and Scoping\n\n**Key Finding:** The documentation does **not explicitly address** whether MCP servers can be loaded on-demand or scoped to specific slash commands. However, the MCP guide confirms that servers support project-level configuration, which provides some task-specific organization capability.\n\nFor detailed implementation options, you may need to consult the complete [MCP configuration documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp.md) or contact Anthropic support.",

These servers remain private to you and are only accessible when working within the current project directory.\"\n- **Project scope**: Stored in `.mcp.json` at your project root, shared via version control with team members\n- **User scope**: \"Available across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account\"\n\n## On-Demand Loading\n\nThe documentation doesn't explicitly describe on-demand loading. All configured servers start automatically when Claude Code launches. However, you can manage servers dynamically:\n\n- Add servers: `claude mcp add`\n- Remove unused servers: `claude mcp remove`\n- Check status: `/mcp` command within Claude Code\n- Configure timeout: `MCP_TIMEOUT` environment variable\n\n**Scope precedence**: Local configurations override project-scoped ones, which override user-scoped settings.",
